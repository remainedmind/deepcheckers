# deepcheckers
Simple game based on checkers game, where human plays against Neural Network

### CURRENTLY UNDER THE DEVELOPMENT

## NOTE
I decided to build the project based on another game firstly. [Here](https://github.com/remainedmind/deepreversi) is it. After I finish with that game, I will turn back to Checkers

## What's abailable?
- console game prototype. Game it completely working and allows 
playing with computer. Up for now, computer plays, making 
moves randomly. It's going to be based on NN later.
- It's possible to configure the desc size

Later, there will be ability to play human-two-human.
